\subsection{Short term abnormal returns in the Market Model}

To test hypothesis #1 and #2 of whether negative and positive SDG related events impacts firm value on the short term, we set apart negative and positive events and assess the aggregated development in abnormal returns 10 days before and 10 days after an event. Moreover, we isolate the effect of the individual SDGs to test hypothesis #4 of whether events on some sustainability goals are more relevant for investors than other. We apply the Market Model to measure abnormal returns around an event.   

\subsubsection{Positive news}

The average abnormal returns and cumulative average abnormal returns retrieved from the Market Model are illustrated in table \ref{ST_tab}. 
The effect of positive events on average stock behavior of all portfolios is mostly positive leading up to an event, which indicates a leakage effect. The positive AAR in this period provides basis for an increasing trend in CAAR leading up to the event date. However, at time $t = 0$ and all subsequent days the AAR is slightly negative, which results in the cumulative effect decreasing after the $t = 0$ and ends in negative territory at -0.2\%. The development in AAR and CAAR along with its  after positive events is also portrayed in figure
