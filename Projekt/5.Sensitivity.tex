In this section I cross-validate the robustness of the initials results by re-estimating the models with altered variables in order to confirm that the appearance of over-performance is not created artificially. Thus, the practice can lead to validation or invalidation along with advancement of model specifications. 

For the Market Model and the Calendar Time Portfolio I 1) alter the threshold for events to be considered as important from one to two and three standard deviations, and 2) change the portfolio weights from being based on market capitalization (value) to a naive approach (equal). Due to insignificance and borderline randomness of the relation between positive events and returns I only present the plots related to negative events. The comparable graphs of the positive events can be found in Appendix \ref{fig:ST_pos_sensi}.

\subsection{Market model: event threshold} \label{sec: sens_st_sd}

The requirements behind the thresholds for event identification is based on the volume of events relative to the average throughout the full sample for a given firm. Increasing the threshold naturally leads to fewer stocks included in the calculation of average abnormal returns. Intuitively, an increase in the tightness of the threshold is expected capture more extreme events, which should to lead to higher abnormal returns in absolute values, if firms with larger events are penalized harder.

     \caption*{\footnotesize The figure illustrates the AAR and CAAR around the event date (t = 0) of negative news. The various colors represent the event identification rule of 1, 2, or 3 standard errors. The groups have, respectively, 1618, 1,231, and 997 events for 1,2, and 3 standard deviations}
    \label{fig:ST_neg_sensitivity}
\end{figure} 

Figure \ref{fig:ST_neg_sensitivity} compares the outcomes from changing the threshold of events. The AAR is presented in dotted lines and the CAAR in solid lines for thresholds applying 2 standard deviations (green) and 3 standard deviations (blue). For simplicity, I omit the confidence intervals along with the bars. The similarities of the AAR and CAAR imply that the results are robust to changes in the methodology. Enforcing a stronger threshold requirement leads to a larger instantaneous impact on the event date, indicated by the lower AAR on $t=0$. However, the overall CAAR is less significant for both 2 and 3 standard deviations relative to 1. Thus, in contrast with common intuition, a tighter threshold leads to lower overall returns from the identified events.  

\subsection{Market model: value vs. equal weights} \label{sec: sens_st_weights}

A portfolio of stocks needs to implement a weighting procedure in order to determine the relative impact of individual constituents on portfolio performance. Figure \ref{fig:ST_neg_sensitivity_weight} compares the performance of applying value and equal weights to a portfolio consisting of an identical sample of firms that have experienced a negative event. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Negative news: Value vs. Equal weights}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Projekt/1.Figures analysis/ST_negative_sensitivity_weight.png}
     \caption*{\footnotesize The figure illustrates the average abnormal return (AAR) and cumulative AAR (CAAR) around the event date (t = 0) of negative news. The blue lines are returns calculated from an equally weighted portfolio, while the red lines are based on market capitalization weights.}
    \label{fig:ST_neg_sensitivity_weight}
\end{figure} 

From a visual perspective, the abnormal returns from applying equal weights validate the original results, as the CAAR over the full window is approximately equivalent to applying value weights. While the portfolio AARs follow each other to some extent, the development in CAAR is more adverse using equal weights relative to value weights. Applying equal weights inevitably allocates more weight to smaller stocks, which apparently contribute to a more severe investor reaction. In the days leading up to the event the equal weighted portfolio CAAR decreases at a faster rate, which results in a lower bottom of approximately 1.0\%. However, after the spike in news has occurred the CAAR reverts to the same level as the value weighted portfolio. 

\subsection{Calendar Time Portfolio: Portfolio weights}

Table \ref{tab: FF5_sensitivity} reports the alphas, t-values and significance levels of equally weighted portfolios along with the results from changing the threshold requirements. Besides the weights, the portfolio construction is identical to that from the empirical results in section \ref{sec: long_term_portfolio}. 

Altering the portfolio weights from value to equal clearly indicate a discrepancy from measurement with the latter generating higher absolute alpha values. The value weighted portfolio with T = 1 generated abnormal returns of -0.84\%, while the equivalent portfolio with equal weights ends up at -0.96\% significant on the $1\%$ level.   

The results are in contrast with the short term sensitivity analysis on portfolio weights, where the equal weighted portfolio generated lower abnormal returns. Again, the increased allocation toward smaller stocks seems to have an influential impact on the long run, however in the opposite direction relative to the short term. Applying holding periods of T = 8 and 12 months generate significant alpha as well indicating that smaller stocks are penalized over a longer time horizon than relatively larger ones.   

The abnormal returns of the equal weighted portfolios confirm the negative association between negative events and abnormal returns and to some degree the magnitude of the value weighted portfolio returns.

\subsection{Calendar Time Portfolio: Thresholds}

Altering the threshold requirements from one to two and three standard leads to varying outcomes. For holding periods of one month, the alphas decrease and become insignificant from tightening the threshold, however the portfolio with three standard errors produce larger alphas than the one with two. With T = 4 the relation is reverse as the 2 standard deviation portfolio generates the largest alpha. Longer holding periods generate roughly equal abnormal returns across threshold values. As the portfolios are generating seemingly random outcomes, I reason that there is no relation between the event threshold and portfolio return on the long horizon. 


\subsection{Inference from global companies}

In order to further assess the robustness of the results, I reiterate the main parts of the empirical analysis with a completely new sample of firms and corresponding SDG news data. The sample consists of constituent firms from the Nasdaq Global Large Cap Index. In addition to providing robustness, the assessment also generates insights into the global perspective on the relation between ESG and corporate performance. \\
The impact from positive news on global companies are slightly different from European companies. High risk companies are to a larger degree being rewarded for positive news, whereas the impact on medium and low risk companies are close to zero. However, since the remaining part of the paper will focus mostly on negative news, I will do the same here. The AAR and CAAR graphs for all firms and split on ESG risk for positive events are available in appendix \ref{app: sensitivity}. On negative news, the shareholder reaction is approximately equivalent across European and global companies with CAAR values around -0.6\%. Again, most of the decline happens before the event is identified.
