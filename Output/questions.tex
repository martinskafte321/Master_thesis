Questions for Stefan:

1. What is the optimal market return to use in the CAPM model? Is STOXX 600 EUR fine, now that it is those stocks I'm analysing. 

2. Do you have any suggestions on which model/method to apply when analyzing the long term effect in a event study methodology? I'm currently looking into the Calendar Time Portfolio Approach (using a factor model)

3. Should I remove the 1\% outliers?
